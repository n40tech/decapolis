Liberalism is a political and philosophical ideology that values individual freedom, equality, and the protection of civil liberties as fundamental principles. It promotes a limited role for government intervention in people's lives, emphasizing personal autonomy, human rights, and the rule of law. Liberals generally advocate for a free-market economy with some regulation to prevent abuses and ensure fairness.

Liberalism encompasses a wide range of beliefs and perspectives, including classical liberalism, which emphasizes minimal government intervention in economic and social affairs, and modern liberalism, which supports a more active role for government in addressing social inequality and providing a social safety net. Liberalism has been influential in the development of democratic systems and has played a significant role in shaping modern societies by championing individual rights and the pursuit of personal happiness and well-being.
