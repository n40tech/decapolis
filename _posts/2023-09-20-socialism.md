Socialism is a socio-economic and political ideology that advocates for the collective ownership and control of the means of production and distribution of wealth. In a socialist system, the goal is to create a more equitable society by reducing economic inequality and ensuring that resources are allocated based on need rather than profit. This often involves the government or some form of collective ownership overseeing key industries and services, such as healthcare, education, and transportation. Socialism aims to provide essential goods and services to all citizens while striving to minimize the disparities in wealth and power that can exist in capitalist systems. It is a diverse ideology with various interpretations and implementations around the world, ranging from democratic socialism to more centralized, state-controlled forms.
