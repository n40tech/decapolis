Nationalism is a political and cultural ideology centered on a deep attachment to one's nation or ethnic group. It emphasizes a strong sense of identity, pride, and loyalty towards one's country, often prioritizing its interests above those of other nations. Nationalism can manifest in various forms, from benign expressions of cultural pride and patriotism to more extreme and exclusionary ideologies.

While nationalism can foster a sense of unity and shared purpose among a nation's citizens, it can also lead to conflicts when it takes on an extreme and aggressive character, promoting intolerance towards other nations or ethnic groups. It has played a significant role in shaping the course of history, influencing everything from international relations and territorial disputes to the development of political movements and ideologies.
