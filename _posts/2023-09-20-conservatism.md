Conservatism is a political and social ideology that values tradition, order, stability, and a limited role for government intervention in society and the economy. It emphasizes the preservation of existing institutions, customs, and values as a means of ensuring societal continuity and gradual change. Conservatives often believe that established norms and practices have evolved over time to provide stability and should be respected and upheld.

Key principles of conservatism include a belief in the importance of individual liberty, a preference for free-market capitalism, and a skepticism toward rapid social or political change. Conservatives tend to advocate for a strong national defense, law and order, and a traditional moral and cultural framework.

Conservatism varies in its interpretation and application, with some conservatives leaning toward more libertarian views, favoring minimal government involvement, and others supporting a more paternalistic or social conservative approach. It is a diverse political ideology that has played a significant role in shaping the policies and politics of various countries around the world.
