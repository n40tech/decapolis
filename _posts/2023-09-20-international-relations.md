International relations is the field of study and practice that focuses on the interactions and relationships between countries and states on a global scale. It encompasses various aspects of diplomacy, politics, economics, security, culture, and more. The primary goals of international relations are to understand, analyze, and manage the complex interactions and conflicts that occur among nations.

Scholars and practitioners in the field of international relations examine topics such as international diplomacy, foreign policy, trade agreements, international organizations (e.g., the United Nations), conflict resolution, and the balance of power among nations. They seek to explain the causes of international events, predict future developments, and work toward creating a more stable and cooperative international system.

International relations play a crucial role in shaping the world's political landscape and have a significant impact on issues like global security, trade, human rights, and environmental cooperation. The field is multidisciplinary, drawing on insights from political science, economics, history, sociology, and other disciplines to provide a comprehensive understanding of how countries interact and cooperate on the international stage.
